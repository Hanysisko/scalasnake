ScalaSnake in React with Hooks and canvas

functionalities to add:
- ✓ adding mines 
- ✓ local score 
- ? global score (need more info)
- (in progress as another component) modal when finishing game with reset button
- ? maybe start on enter (optional)

problems to solve
- ✓(kinda) better styling (f.e. color themes in variables; for canvas) (update: I just put everything in color palette of my gameboard, pls, don't laugh at me)
- problem with snake going in opposite direction; 
  f.e. when going up, it should ignore ArrowDown, not to collapse on itself
- comments next to functions (still need more probably)
- NEW there's small chance that bomb can generate on apple, meybe even in snake etc. - I need to check on that later
