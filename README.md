Snake Game in React

functionalities to add:
- adding mines
- global score?
- modal when finishing game with reset button
- maybe start on enter?

problems to solve
- better styling (f.e. color themes in variables; for canvas)
- problem with snake going in opposite direction; 
  f.e. when going up, it should ignore ArrowDown, not to collapse on itself
- comments next to functions
